## Confidential Tokens

### Questions

- 1). Discuss in your teams the need for confidential tokens
- 2). Have you / do you want to use ZCash or other confidential
  tokens ?
- 3). The future for Aztec and private transactions on Ethereum
  in light of what has happened to Tornado Cash.

### Answers

- 1). There are many reasons for confidential tokens the general principle of privacy in transactions has existed since cash was invented. It is only with the advent of electronic transfer was that anonimity taken away. Once specific use that I think is unique to crypo is due to the transparancy of transactions. It is often the case that prominant people in an ecosystem or project can be linked to an on-chain address. Any movement of funds to or from that address is often seen as an indicator of health of the project and causes fluctuations in price that can adversly affect investors.

- 2). I have used the Secret cosmos chain. Which has customizable privacy. You can choose who you want to share your data with.
- 3). Fully private solutions will always fall foul of the regulations. I think the future will lie in solutions where the choice of sharing the data is in their control, not ones where the data is always hidden.

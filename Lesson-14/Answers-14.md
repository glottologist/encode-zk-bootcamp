## Secret Sharing

### Questions

Try out Shamir secret sharing

 -1). Create a polynomial with the secret being the constant term $a0$ , the other a values $(a_1. . . a_4)$ can be chosen at
random. The polynomial will be of the form

$y(x) = a_4x^4 + a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$

- 2). Calculate the y values for five x values by evaluating the polynomial, these are the shares.

- 3). Reconstruct the polynomial using those shares and an online interpolation calculator such as https://planetcalc.com/8680/

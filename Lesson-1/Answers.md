## Modular Arithmetic

### Questions

1. Working with the following set of integers $S={0,1,2,3,4,5,6}$. What is:
   a). $4 + 4$
   b). $3 X 5$
   c). what is the inverse of 3?
2. For $S={0,1,2,3,4,5,6}$. Can we consider the $S$ and the operation $+$ to be a group?
3. What is -13 mod 5?

### Answers

1.  The set $S$ is closed under $mod 7$ so:
    a). $4+4\equiv 8 \bmod{7}=1$
    b). $3x5\equiv 15 \bmod{7}=1$
    c).
      i). For the additive inverse we are looking for a variable that satisfies $a+b=0 \bmod{7}$. If $3$ is the given number then we look to satisfy $3+a=0 \bmod{7}$. We can see that $4$ staisfiys the equation - $3+4=0 \bmod{7}$.
      ii). For the multiplicative inverse we are looking for a variable that satisfies $a*b=1 \bmod{7}$. If $3$ is the given number then we look to satisfy $3*a=1 \bmod{7}$. We can see that $5$ staisfiys the equation - $3*5=1 \bmod{7}$.
